    "Imagine that you are building a software for transcribing speech to text. The speech transcription part works perfectly, but cannot transcribe punctuations. The task is to train a predictive model to ingest a sequence of text and add punctuation (period, comma or question mark) in the appropriate locations. This task is important for all downstream data processing jobs. <br /><br />\n",

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Although sentence must adhere to specific grammar rules, one might try to build a rule-based system for punctuation restoration. However, there are three weaknesses if one wants to do this:\n",
    "1. A common problem is that most people don't follow grammar rules when speaking.\n",
    "2. Writing a rule-based system for punctuation restoration requires prior knowledge on specific grammar rules for a language.\n",
    "3. The approach of building a rule-based system for punctuation restoration for a specific language can not generalize to other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the following solution solves the above problems by incorporating [bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN)](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S20/document/readings/Bidirectional%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.pdf) with an [attention mechanism](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) for punctuation restoration in unsegmented text.\n",
    "\n",
    "My solution is largely based on [Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network with Attention Mechanism for Punctuation Restoration](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2016/pdfs/1517.PDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is defined as follows:\n",
    "1. Obtain words embeddings from [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",
    "2. The word embeddings are then processed by densely connected [Bi-LSTM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5778.pdf) layers.\n",
    "3. These Bi-LSTM layers are followed by a RNN with an attention mechanism and [conditional random field (CRF)](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1162&context=cis_papers) log likelihood loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons are as follows:\n",
    "1. GloVe obtains vector representations for words. It enforces the word vectors to capture sub-linear relationships in the vector space.\n",
    "2. BRNN enables the model to make use of unfixed length contexts before and after the current position in text. In the recurrent layers, I use [LSTM](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) which is well suited for capturing long range dependencies on multiple time scales.\n",
    "3. An attention mechanism further increases the model's capacity of finding relevant parts of the context for punctuation decisions. For example, the model might focus on words that indicate a question, but may be relatively far from the current word. An attention mechanism could nudge the model towards ending the sentence with a question mark instead of a period.\n",

    "- From the Exploratory Data Analysis section, it is obvious that most words are not followed by any punctuation marks. The punctuation samples for the majority of these words can be succeessfully classified by the model and make the general accuracy (general accuracy = 1 - ERR) of the classification beyond 90%.\n",
    "- In pupose of predicting puncutation marks, we care more about the performance on predicting period, comma and question mark. Therefore, the words that are not followed by any punctuation marks are ignored. The model is evaluated in terms of per punctuation and overall precision, recall and F1 score. I also report the overall [slot error rate (SER)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=46A91ADB72135D6B2D6589AA5A1D6AD3?doi=10.1.1.27.4637&rep=rep1&type=pdf), as F1 score has been shown to have some undesireable properties in [Performance Measures for Information Extraction](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=46A91ADB72135D6B2D6589AA5A1D6AD3?doi=10.1.1.27.4637&rep=rep1&type=pdf).\n",
    "- There are three types of errors: substitution, deletion and insertion.\n",
    "- Precision measures the percentage of correctly predicted punctuation marks in all predicted punctuation marks. It deals with substitution and insertion errors. Higher is better.\n",
    "- Recall measures the percentage of correctly predicted punctuation marks in all expected punctuation marks. It deals with substitution and deletion errors. Higher is better.\n",
    "- F1 score and SER are used to have a single measure of performance that deals with all three types of errors simultaneously. For F1 score, higher is better. In contrast, lower SER is better.\n",
    "- The model reaches the best performance on both reference transcripts and ASR output in 5 epochs.\n",
    "- The result shows that comma restoration is a harder task than period and question mark restoration. I think it is normal because the grammatical ambiguity of a pause is generally higher than a full-stop, espacially in less formal text like the transcript of TED talks.\n",
    "- The result shows that punctuation restoration is a harder task on ASR output than reference transcripts. I think it is normal because there are likely more noise and errors introduced in ASR output.\n",
    "- As we can see, the model achieves comparable performance comparing to the models published in [Punctuation Prediction for Unsegmented Transcript Based on Word Vector](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/meinel/papers/2016_Che_LREC.pdf) and [Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network with Attention Mechanism for Punctuation Restoration](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2016/pdfs/1517.PDF)."

    "    - Pre-trained BERT has more capacity and was trained a much larger corpus.\n",
