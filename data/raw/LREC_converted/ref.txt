i  'm  a  savant <comma> or  more  precisely <comma> a  high-functioning  autistic  savant <period> it  's  a  rare  condition <period> and  rarer  still  when  accompanied <comma> as  in  my  case <comma> by  self-awareness  and  a  mastery  of  language <period> very  often  when  i  meet  someone  and  they  learn  this  about  me  there  's  a  certain  kind  of  awkwardness <period> i  can  see  it  in  their  eyes <period> they  want  to  ask  me  something <period> and  in  the  end <comma> quite  often <comma> the  urge  is  stronger  than  they  are  and  they  blurt  it  out <comma> if  i  give  you  my  date  of  birth <comma> can  you  tell  me  what  day  of  the  week  i  was  born  on <questionmark> or  they  mention  cube  roots  or  ask  me  to  recite  a  long  number  or  long  text <period> i  hope  you  'll  forgive  me  if  i  do  n't  perform  a  kind  of  one-man  savant  show  for  you  today <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  instead  about  something  far  more  interesting  than  dates  of  birth  or  cube  roots <comma> a  little  deeper  and  a  lot  closer <comma> to  my  mind <comma> than  work <period> i  want  to  talk  to  you  briefly  about  perception <period> when  he  was  writing  the  plays  and  the  short  stories  that  would  make  his  name <comma> anton  chekhov  kept  a  notebook  in  which  he  noted  down  his  observations  of  the  world  around  him <comma> little  details  that  other  people  seem  to  miss <period> every  time  i  read  chekhov  and  his  unique  vision  of  human  life <comma> i  'm  reminded  of  why  i  too  became  a  writer <period> in  my  books <comma> i  explore  the  nature  of  perception  and  how  different  kinds  of  perceiving  create  different  kinds  of  knowing  and  understanding <period> here  are  three  questions  drawn  from  my  work <period> rather  than  try  to  figure  them  out <comma> i  'm  going  to  ask  you  to  consider  for  a  moment  the  intuitions  and  the  gut  instincts  that  are  going  through  your  head  and  your  heart  as  you  look  at  them <period> for  example <comma> the  calculation <period> can  you  feel  where  on  the  number  line  the  solution  is  likely  to  fall <questionmark> or  look  at  the  foreign  word  and  the  sounds <period> can  you  get  a  sense  of  the  range  of  meanings  that  it  's  pointing  you  towards <questionmark> and  in  terms  of  the  line  of  poetry <comma> why  does  the  poet  use  the  word  hare  rather  than  rabbit <questionmark> i  'm  asking  you  to  do  this  because  i  believe  our  personal  perceptions <comma> you  see <comma> are  at  the  heart  of  how  we  acquire  knowledge <period> aesthetic  judgments <comma> rather  than  abstract  reasoning <comma> guide  and  shape  the  process  by  which  we  all  come  to  know  what  we  know <period> i  'm  an  extreme  example  of  this <period> my  worlds  of  words  and  numbers  blur  with  color <comma> emotion  and  personality <period> as  juan  said <comma> it  's  the  condition  that  scientists  call  synesthesia <comma> an  unusual  cross-talk  between  the  senses <period> here  are  the  numbers  one  to  12  as  i  see  them <comma> every  number  with  its  own  shape  and  character <period> one  is  a  flash  of  white  light <period> six  is  a  tiny  and  very  sad  black  hole <period> the  sketches  are  in  black  and  white  here <comma> but  in  my  mind  they  have  colors <period> three  is  green <period> four  is  blue <period> five  is  yellow <period> i  paint  as  well <period> and  here  is  one  of  my  paintings <period> it  's  a  multiplication  of  two  prime  numbers <period> three-dimensional  shapes  and  the  space  they  create  in  the  middle  creates  a  new  shape <comma> the  answer  to  the  sum <period> what  about  bigger  numbers <questionmark> well  you  cannot  get  much  bigger  than  pi <comma> the  mathematical  constant <period> it  's  an  infinite  number <comma> literally  goes  on  forever <period> in  this  painting  that  i  made  of  the  first  20  decimals  of  pi <comma> i  take  the  colors  and  the  emotions  and  the  textures  and  i  pull  them  all  together  into  a  kind  of  rolling  numerical  landscape <period> but  it  's  not  only  numbers  that  i  see  in  colors <period> words  too <comma> for  me <comma> have  colors  and  emotions  and  textures <period> and  this  is  an  opening  phrase  from  the  novel  lolita <period> and  nabokov  was  himself  synesthetic <period> and  you  can  see  here  how  my  perception  of  the  sound  l  helps  the  alliteration  to  jump  right  out <period> another  example <comma> a  little  bit  more  mathematical <period> and  i  wonder  if  some  of  you  will  notice  the  construction  of  the  sentence  from  the  great  gatsby <period> there  is  a  procession  of  syllables <comma> wheat <comma> one <period> prairies <comma> two <period> lost  swede  towns <comma> three <comma> one <comma> two <comma> three <period> and  this  effect  is  very  pleasant  on  the  mind <comma> and  it  helps  the  sentence  to  feel  right <period> let  's  go  back  to  the  questions  i  posed  you  a  moment  ago <period> 64  multiplied  by  75 <period> if  some  of  you  play  chess <comma> you  'll  know  that  64  is  a  square  number <comma> and  that  's  why  chessboards <comma> eight  by  eight <comma> have  64  squares <period> so  that  gives  us  a  form  that  we  can  picture <comma> that  we  can  perceive <period> what  about  75 <questionmark> well  if  100 <comma> if  we  think  of  100  as  being  like  a  square <comma> 75  would  look  like  this <period> so  what  we  need  to  do  now  is  put  those  two  pictures  together  in  our  mind <comma> something  like  this <period> 64  becomes  6,400 <period> and  in  the  right-hand  corner <comma> you  do  n't  have  to  calculate  anything <period> four  across <comma> four  up  and  down <comma> it  's  16 <period> so  what  the  sum  is  actually  asking  you  to  do  is  16 <comma> 16 <comma> 16 <period> that  's  a  lot  easier  than  the  school  taught  you  to  do  math <comma> i  'm  sure <period> it  's  16 <comma> 16 <comma> 16 <comma> 48 <comma> 4,800 <comma> 4,000 <comma> the  answer  to  the  sum <period> easy  when  you  know  how <period> the  second  question  was  an  icelandic  word <period> i  'm  assuming  there  are  not  many  people  here  who  speak  icelandic <period> so  let  me  narrow  the  choices  down  to  two <period> is  it  a  happy  word <comma> or  a  sad  word <questionmark> what  do  you  say <questionmark> okay <period> some  people  say  it  's  happy <period> most  people <comma> a  majority  of  people <comma> say  sad <period> and  it  actually  means  sad <period> why  do <comma> statistically <comma> a  majority  of  people  say  that  a  word  is  sad <comma> in  this  case <comma> heavy  in  other  cases <questionmark> in  my  theory <comma> language  evolves  in  such  a  way  that  sounds  match <comma> correspond  with  the  subjective <comma> with  the  personal  intuitive  experience  of  the  listener <period> let  's  have  a  look  at  the  third  question <period> it  's  a  line  from  a  poem  by  john  keats <period> words <comma> like  numbers <comma> express  fundamental  relationships  between  objects  and  events  and  forces  that  constitute  our  world <period> it  stands  to  reason  that  we <comma> existing  in  this  world <comma> should  in  the  course  of  our  lives  absorb  intuitively  those  relationships <period> and  poets <comma> like  other  artists <comma> play  with  those  intuitive  understandings <period> in  the  case  of  hare <comma> it  's  an  ambiguous  sound  in  english <period> it  can  also  mean  the  fibers  that  grow  from  a  head <period> and  if  we  think  of  that <comma> let  me  put  the  picture  up <comma> the  fibers  represent  vulnerability <period> they  yield  to  the  slightest  movement  or  motion  or  emotion <period> so  what  you  have  is  an  atmosphere  of  vulnerability  and  tension <period> the  hare  itself <comma> the  animal <comma> not  a  cat <comma> not  a  dog <comma> a  hare <comma> why  a  hare <questionmark> because  think  of  the  picture <comma> not  the  word <comma> the  picture <period> the  overlong  ears <comma> the  overlarge  feet <comma> helps  us  to  picture <comma> to  feel  intuitively <comma> what  it  means  to  limp  and  to  tremble <period> so  in  these  few  minutes <comma> i  hope  i've  been  able  to  share  a  little  bit  of  my  vision  of  things <comma> and  to  show  you  that  words  can  have  colors  and  emotions <comma> numbers <comma> shapes  and  personalities <period> the  world  is  richer <comma> vaster  than  it  too  often  seems  to  be <period> i  hope  that  i've  given  you  the  desire  to  learn  to  see  the  world  with  new  eyes <period> thank  you <period> i  'm  a  contemporary  artist  with  a  bit  of  an  unexpected  background <period> i  was  in  my  20s  before  i  ever  went  to  an  art  museum <period> i  grew  up  in  the  middle  of  nowhere  on  a  dirt  road  in  rural  arkansas <comma> an  hour  from  the  nearest  movie  theater <period> and  i  think  it  was  a  great  place  to  grow  up  as  an  artist <comma> because  i  grew  up  around  quirky <comma> colorful  characters  who  were  great  at  making  with  their  hands <period> and  my  childhood  is  more  hick  than  i  could  ever  possibly  relate  to  you <comma> and  also  more  intellectual  than  you  would  ever  expect <period> for  instance <comma> me  and  my  sister <comma> when  we  were  little <comma> we  would  compete  to  see  who  could  eat  the  most  squirrel  brains <period> but  on  the  other  side  of  that  though <comma> we  were  big  readers  in  our  house <period> and  if  the  tv  was  on <comma> we  were  watching  a  documentary <period> and  my  dad  is  the  most  voracious  reader  i  know <period> he  can  read  a  novel  or  two  a  day <period> but  when  i  was  little <comma> i  remember <comma> he  would  kill  flies  in  our  house  with  my  bb  gun <period> and  what  was  so  amazing  to  me  about  that <comma> well  he  would  be  in  his  recliner <comma> would  holler  for  me  to  fetch  the  bb  gun <comma> and  i'd  go  get  it <period> and  what  was  amazing  to  me <comma> well  it  was  pretty  kickass <period> he  was  killing  a  fly  in  the  house  with  a  gun <comma> but  what  was  so  amazing  to  me  was  that  he  knew  just  enough  how  to  pump  it <period> and  he  could  shoot  it  from  two  rooms  away  and  not  damage  what  it  was  on <comma> because  he  knew  how  to  pump  it  just  enough  to  kill  the  fly  and  not  damage  what  it  landed  on <period> so  i  should  talk  about  art <period> or  we  'll  be  here  all  day  with  my  childhood  stories <period> i  love  contemporary  art <comma> but  i  'm  often  really  frustrated  with  the  contemporary  art  world  and  the  contemporary  art  scene <period> a  few  years  ago <comma> i  spent  months  in  europe  to  see  the  major  international  art  exhibitions  that  have  the  pulse  of  what  is  supposed  to  be  going  on  in  the  art  world <period> and  i  was  struck  by  going  to  so  many <comma> one  after  the  other <comma> with  some  clarity  of  what  it  was  that  i  was  longing  for <period> and  i  was  longing  for  several  things  that  i  was  n't  getting <comma> or  not  getting  enough  of <period> but  two  of  the  main  things <comma> one  of  it <comma> i  was  longing  for  more  work  that  was  appealing  to  a  broad  public <comma> that  was  accessible <period> and  the  second  thing  that  i  was  longing  for  was  some  more  exquisite  craftsmanship  and  technique <period> so  i  started  thinking  and  listing  what  all  it  was  that  i  thought  would  make  a  perfect  biennial <period> so  i  decided <comma> i  'm  going  to  start  my  own  biennial <period> i  'm  going  to  organize  it  and  direct  it  and  get  it  going  in  the  world <period> so  i  thought <comma> okay <comma> i  have  to  have  some  criteria  of  how  to  choose  work <period> so  amongst  all  the  criteria  i  have <comma> there  's  two  main  things <period> one  of  them <comma> i  call  my  mimaw  's  test <period> and  what  that  is  is  i  imagine  explaining  a  work  of  art  to  my  grandmother  in  five  minutes <period> and  if  i  can  explain  it  in  five  minutes <comma> then  it  's  too  obtuse  or  esoteric  and  it  has  n't  been  refined  enough  yet <period> it  needs  to  worked  on  until  it  can  speak  fluently <period> and  then  my  other  second  set  of  rules <comma> i  hate  to  say  rules  because  it  's  art <comma> my  criteria  would  be  the  three  h  's <comma> which  is  head <comma> heart  and  hands <period> and  great  art  would  have  head <comma> it  would  have  interesting  intellectual  ideas  and  concepts <period> it  would  have  heart  in  that  it  would  have  passion  and  heart  and  soul <period> and  it  would  have  hand  in  that  it  would  be  greatly  crafted <period> so  i  started  thinking  about  how  am  i  going  to  do  this  biennial <comma> how  am  i  going  to  travel  the  world  and  find  these  artists <period> and  then  i  realized  one  day <comma> there  's  an  easier  solution  to  this <period> i  'm  just  going  to  make  the  whole  thing  myself <period> and  so  this  is  what  i  did <period> so  i  thought <comma> a  biennial  needs  artists <period> i  'm  going  to  do  an  international  biennial <comma> i  need  artists  from  all  around  the  world <period> so  what  i  did  was  i  invented  a  hundred  artists  from  around  the  world <period> i  figured  out  their  bios <comma> their  their  passions  in  life  and  their  art  styles <comma> and  i  started  making  their  work <period> i  felt <comma> oh  this  is  the  kind  of  project  that  i  could  spend  my  whole  life  doing <period> so  i  decided <comma> i  'm  going  to  make  this  a  real  biennial <period> it  's  going  to  be  two  years  of  studio  work <period> and  i  'm  going  to  create  this  in  two  years <period> and  i  have <period> so  i  should  start  to  talk  about  these  guys <period> well  the  range  is  quite  a  bit <period> and  i  'm  such  a  technician <comma> so  i  loved  project <comma> getting  to  play  with  all  the  techniques <period> so  for  example <comma> in  realist  paintings <comma> it  ranges  from  this <comma> which  is  kind  of  old  masters  style <comma> to  really  realistic  still-life <comma> to  this  type  of  painting  where  i  'm  painting  with  a  single  hair <period> and  then  at  the  other  end <comma> there  's  performance  and  short  films  and  indoor  installations  like  this  indoor  installation  and  this  one <comma> and  outdoor  installations  like  this  one  and  this  one <period> i  know  i  should  mention <comma> i  'm  making  all  these  things <period> this  is  n't  photoshopped <period> i  'm  under  the  river  with  those  fish <period> so  now  let  me  introduce  some  of  my  fictional  artists  to  you <period> this  is  nell  remmel <period> nell  is  interested  in  agricultural  processes <comma> and  her  work  is  based  in  these  practices <period> this  piece <comma> which  is  called  flipped  earth <comma> she  was  interested  in  taking  the  sky  and  using  it  to  cleanse  barren  ground <period> and  by  taking  giant  mirrors <comma> and  here  she  's  taking  giant  mirrors  and  pulling  them  into  the  dirt <period> and  this  is  22  ft <period> long <period> and  what  i  loved  about  her  work  is <comma> when  i  would  walk  around  it  and  look  down  into  the  sky <comma> looking  down  to  watch  the  sky <comma> and  it  unfolded  in  a  new  way <period> and  probably  the  best  part  of  this  piece  is  at  dusk  and  dawn  when  the  twilight  wedge  has  fallen  and  the  ground  's  dark <comma> but  there  's  still  the  light  above <comma> bright  above <period> and  so  you  're  standing  there  and  everything  else  is  dark <comma> but  there  's  this  portal  that  you  want  to  jump  in <period> this  piece  was  great <period> this  is  in  my  parents  backyard  in  arkansas <period> and  i  love  to  dig  a  hole <period> so  this  piece  was  great  fun <comma> because  it  was  two  days  of  digging  in  soft  dirt <period> the  next  artist  is  kay  overstry <comma> and  she  's  interested  in  ephemerality  and  transience <period> and  in  her  most  recent  project <comma> it  's  called  weather  i  made <period> and  she  's  making  weather  on  her  body  's  scale <period> and  this  piece  is  frost <period> and  what  she  did  was  she  went  out  on  a  cold <comma> dry  night  and  breathed  back  and  forth  on  the  lawn  to  leave <comma> to  leave  her  life  's  mark <comma> the  mark  of  her  life <period> and  so  this  is  five  foot <comma> five  inches  of  frost  that  she  left  behind <period> the  sun  rises <comma> and  it  melts  away <period> and  that  was  played  by  my  mom <period> so  the  next  artist <comma> this  is  a  group  of  japanese  artists <comma> a  collective  of  japanese  artists <comma> in  tokyo <period> and  they  were  interested  in  developing  a  new <comma> alternative  art  space <period> and  they  needed  funding  for  it <comma> so  they  decided  to  come  up  with  some  interesting  fundraising  projects <period> one  of  these  is  scratch-off  masterpieces <period> and  so  what  they  're  doing <comma> each  of  these  artists  on  a  nine  by  seven-inch  card <comma> which  they  sell  for  10  bucks <comma> they  drew  original  works  of  art <period> and  you  buy  one <comma> and  maybe  you  get  a  real  piece <comma> and  maybe  not <period> well  this  has  sparked  a  craze  in  japan <comma> because  everyone  's  wanting  a  masterpiece <period> and  the  ones  that  are  the  most  sought  after  are  the  ones  that  are  only  barely  scratched  off <period> and  all  these  works <comma> in  some  way <comma> talk  about  luck  or  fate  or  chance <period> those  first  two  are  portraits  of  mega-jackpot  winners  years  before  and  after  their  win <period> and  in  this  one  it  's  called  drawing  the  short  stick <period> i  love  these  piece  because  i  have  a  little  cousin  at  home  who  introduced  me <comma> which  i  think  is  such  a  great  introduction <comma> to  a  friend  one  day  as <comma> this  is  my  cousin  shea <period> he  draws  sticks  real  good <period> which  is  one  of  the  best  compliments  ever <period> this  artist  is  gus  weinmueller <comma> and  he  's  doing  a  project <comma> a  large  project <comma> called  art  for  the  peoples <period> and  within  this  project <comma> he  's  doing  a  smaller  project  called  artists  in  residence <period> and  what  he  does  is <comma> he  spends  a  week  at  a  time  with  a  family <period> and  he  shows  up  on  their  porch <comma> their  doorstep <comma> with  a  toothbrush  and  pajamas <comma> and  he  's  ready  to  spend  the  week  with  them <period> and  using  only  what  's  present <comma> he  goes  in  and  makes  a  little  abode  studio  to  work  out  of <period> and  he  spends  that  week  talking  to  the  family  about  what  do  they  think  great  art  is <period> he  has  all  these  discussions  with  their  family <period> and  he  digs  through  everything  they  have <comma> and  he  finds  materials  to  make  work <period> and  he  makes  a  work  that  answers  what  they  think  great  art  is <period> for  this  family <comma> he  made  this  still-life  painting <period> and  whatever  he  makes  somehow  references  nesting  and  space  and  personal  property <period> this  next  project <comma> this  is  by  jaochim  parisvega <comma> and  he  's  interested  in <comma> he  believes  art  is  everywhere  waiting <comma> that  it  just  needs  a  little  bit  of  a  push  to  happen <period> and  he  provides  this  push  by  harnessing  natural  forces <comma> like  in  his  series  where  he  used  rain  to  make  paintings <period> this  project  is  called  love  nests <period> what  he  did  was  to  get  wild  birds  to  make  his  art  for  him <period> so  he  put  the  material  in  places  where  the  birds  were  going  to  collect  them <comma> and  they  crafted  his  nests  for  him <period> and  this  one  's  called  lovelock  's  nest <period> this  one  's  called  mixtape  love  song  's  nest <period> and  this  one  's  called  lovemaking  nest <period> next  is  sylvia  slater <period> sylvia  's  interested  in  art  training <period> she  's  a  very  serious  swiss  artist <period> and  she  was  thinking  about  her  friends  and  family  who  work  in  chaos-ridden  places  and  developing  countries <comma> and  she  was  thinking <comma> what  can  i  make  that  would  be  of  value  to  them <comma> in  case  something  bad  happens  and  they  have  to  buy  their  way  across  the  border  or  pay  off  a  gunman <period> and  so  she  came  up  with  creating  these  pocket-sized  artworks  that  are  portraits  of  the  person  that  would  carry  them <period> and  you  would  carry  this  around  with  you <comma> and  if  everything  went  to  hell <comma> you  could  make  payments  and  buy  your  life <period> so  this  life  price  is  for  an  irrigation  non-profit  director <period> so  hopefully  what  happens  is  you  never  use  it <comma> and  it  's  an  heirloom  that  you  pass  down <period> and  she  makes  them  so  they  could  either  be  broken  up  into  payments <comma> or  they  could  be  like  these <comma> which  are  leaves  that  can  be  payments <period> and  so  they  're  valuable <period> this  is  precious  metals  and  gemstones <period> and  this  one  had  to  get  broken  up <period> he  had  to  break  off  a  piece  to  get  out  of  egypt  recently <period> this  is  by  a  duo <comma> michael  abernathy  and  bud  holland <period> and  they  're  interested  in  creating  culture <comma> just  tradition <period> so  what  they  do  is  they  move  into  an  area  and  try  to  establish  a  new  tradition  in  a  small  geographic  area <period> so  this  is  in  eastern  tennessee <comma> and  what  they  decided  was  that  we  need  a  positive  tradition  that  goes  with  death <period> so  they  came  up  with  dig  jigs <period> and  a  dig  jig <comma> a  dig  jig  is  where <comma> for  a  milestone  anniversary  or  a  birthday <comma> you  gather  all  your  friends  and  family  together  and  you  dance  on  where  you  're  going  to  be  buried <period> and  we  got  a  lot  of  attention  when  we  did  it <period> i  talked  my  family  into  doing  this <comma> and  they  did  n't  know  what  i  was  doing <period> and  i  was  like <comma> get  dressed  for  a  funeral <period> we  're  going  to  go  do  some  work <period> and  so  we  got  to  the  grave  and  made  this <comma> which  was  hilarious <comma> the  attention  that  we  got <period> so  what  happens  is  you  dance  on  the  grave <period> and  after  you've  done  your  dance <comma> everyone  toasts  you  and  tells  you  how  great  you  are <period> and  you  in  essence  have  a  funeral  that  you  get  to  be  present  for <period> that  's  my  mom  and  dad <period> this  is  by  jason  birdsong <period> he  is  interested  in  how  we  see  as  an  animal <comma> how  we  are  interested  in  mimicry  and  camouflage <period> you  know <comma> we  look  down  a  dark  alley  or  a  jungle  path <comma> trying  to  make  out  a  face  or  a  creature <period> we  just  have  that  natural  way  of  seeing <period> and  he  plays  with  this  idea <period> and  this  piece <comma> those  are  n't  actually  leaves <period> they  're  butterfly  specimens  who  have  a  natural  camouflage <period> so  he  pairs  these  up <period> there  's  another  pile  of  leaves <period> those  are  actually  all  real  butterfly  specimens <period> and  he  pairs  these  up  with  paintings <period> like  this  is  a  painting  of  a  snake  in  a  box <period> so  you  open  the  box  and  you  think <comma> who <comma> there  's  a  snake  in  there <period> but  it  's  actually  a  painting <period> so  he  makes  these  interesting  conversations  about  realism  and  mimicry  and  our  drive  to  be  fooled  by  great  camouflage <period> the  next  artist  is  hazel  clausen <period> hazel  clausen  is  an  anthropologist  who  took  a  sabbatical  and  decided <comma> you  know <comma> i  would  learn  a  lot  about  culture  if  i  created  a  culture  that  does  n't  exist  from  scratch <period> so  that  's  what  she  did <period> she  created  the  swiss  people  named  the  uvulites <comma> and  they  have  this  distinctive  yodeling  song  that  they  use  the  uvula  for <period> and  also  they  reference  how  the  uvula <comma> everything  they  say  is  fallen  because  of  the  forbidden  fruit <period> and  that  's  the  symbol  of  their  culture <period> and  this  is  from  a  documentary  called  sexual  practices  and  populations  control  among  the  uvulites <period> this  is  a  typical  angora  embroidery  for  them <period> this  is  one  of  their  founders <comma> gert  schaeffer <period> and  actually  this  is  my  aunt  irene <period> it  was  so  funny  having  a  fake  person  who  was  making  fake  things <period> and  i  crack  up  at  this  piece <comma> because  when  i  see  it  i  know  that  's  french  angora

become <period> so  this  is  one  of  their  comments  on  how  over-coddled  we've  become <period> and  what  they've  done  is  they  put  a  warning  sign  on  every  single  barb  on  this  fence <period> and  this  is  called  horse  sense  fence <period> the  next  artist  is  k <period> m <period> yoon <comma> a  really  interesting  south  korean  artist <period> and  he  's

scary <period> and  it  's  good  that  she  's  not  real <period> she'd  be  mad  that  i  said  that <period> and  she  's  an  optometrist  in  st <period> petersburg <comma> and  she  plays  with

 a  series  of  short  films <period> and  after  this  one <comma> there  's  77  other  artists <period> and  all  together  with  those  other  77  you  're  not  seeing <comma> that  's  my  biennial <period> thank  you <period> <period> my  name  is  joshua  walters <period> i  'm  a  performer <period> but  as  far  as  being  a  performer <comma> i  'm  also  diagnosed  bipolar <period> i  reframe  that  as  a  positive <comma> because  the  crazier  i  get  onstage <comma> the  more  entertaining  i  become <period> when  i  was  16  in  san  francisco <comma> i  had  my  breakthrough  manic  episode  in  which  i  thought  i  was  jesus  christ <period> maybe  you  thought  that  was  scary <comma> but  actually  there  's  no  amount  of  drugs  you  can  take  that  can  get  you  as  high  as  if  you  think  you  're  jesus  christ <period> i  was  sent  to  a  place <comma> a  psych  ward <comma> and  in  the  psych  ward <comma> everyone  is  doing  their  own  one-man  show <period> there  's  no  audience  like  this  to  justify  their  rehearsal  time <period> they  're  just  practicing <period> one  day  they  'll  get  here <period> now  when  i  got  out <comma> i  was  diagnosed  and  i  was  given  medications  by  a  psychiatrist <period> okay <comma> josh <comma> why  do  n't  we  give  you  some <comma> why  do  n't  we  give  you  some  zyprexa <period> okay <questionmark> mmhmm <questionmark> at  least  that  's  what  it  says  on  my  pen <period> some  of  you  are  in  the  field <comma> i  can  see <period> i  can  feel  your  noise <period> the  first  half  of  high  school  was  the  struggle  of  the  manic  episode <comma> and  the  second  half  was  the  overmedications  of  these  drugs <comma> where  i  was  sleeping  through  high  school <period> the  second  half  was  just  one  big  nap <comma> pretty  much <comma> in  class <period> when  i  got  out  i  had  a  choice <period> i  could  either  deny  my  mental  illness  or  embrace  my  mental  skillness <period> there  's  a  movement  going  on  right  now  to  reframe  mental  illness  as  a  positive <comma> at  least  the  hypomanic  edge  part  of  it <period> now  if  you  do  n't  know  what  hypomania  is <comma> it  's  like  an  engine  that  's  out  of  control <comma> maybe  a  ferrari  engine <comma> with  no  breaks <period> many  of  the  speakers  here <comma> many  of  you  in  the  audience <comma> have  that  creative  edge <comma> if  you  know  what  i  'm  talking  about <period> you  're  driven  to  do  something  that  everyone  has  told  you  is  impossible <period> and  there  's  a  book <comma> john  gartner <period> john  gartner  wrote  this  book  called  the  hypomanic  edge  in  which  christopher  columbus  and  ted  turner  and  steve  jobs  and  all  these  business  minds  have  this  edge  to  compete <period> a  different  book  was  written  not  too  long  ago  in  the  mid-90s  called  touched  with  fire  by  kay  redfield  jamison  in  which  it  was  looked  at  in  a  creative  sense  in  which  mozart  and  beethoven  and  van  gogh  all  have  this  manic  depression  that  they  were  suffering  with <period> some  of  them  committed  suicide <period> so  it  was  n't  all  the  good  side  of  the  illness <period> now  recently <comma> there  's  been  development  in  this  field <period> and  there  was  an  article  written  in  the  new  york  times <comma> september  2010 <comma> that  stated <comma> just  manic  enough <period> just  be  manic  enough  in  which  investors  who  are  looking  for  entrepreneurs  that  have  this  kind  of  spectrum <comma> you  know  what  i  'm  talking  about <comma> not  maybe  full  bipolar <comma> but  they  're  in  the  bipolar  spectrum <comma> where  on  one  side <comma> maybe  you  think  you  're  jesus <comma> and  on  the  other  side  maybe  they  just  make  you  a  lot  of  money <period> your  call <period> your  call <period> and  everyone  's  somewhere  in  the  middle <period> everyone  's  somewhere  in  the  middle <period> so  maybe <comma> you  know <comma> there  's  no  such  thing  as  crazy <comma> and  being  diagnosed  with  a  mental  illness  does  n't  mean  you  're  crazy <period> but  maybe  it  just  means  you  're  more  sensitive  to  what  most  people  cannot  see  or  feel <period> maybe  no  one  's  really  crazy <period> everyone  is  just  a  little  bit  mad <period> how  much  depends  on  where  you  fall  in  the  spectrum <period> how  much  depends  on  how  lucky  you  are <period> thank  you <period> it  's  an  amazing  thing  that  we  're  here  to  talk  about  the  year  of  patients  rising <period> you  heard  stories  earlier  today  about  patients  who  are  taking  control  of  their  cases <comma> patients  who  are  saying <comma> you  know  what <comma> i  know  what  the  odds  are <comma> but  i  'm  going  to  go  look  for  more  information <period> i  'm  going  to  define  what  the  terms  of  my  success  are <period> i  'm  going  to  be  sharing  with  you  how  four  years  ago  i  almost  died <comma> found  out  i  was <comma> in  fact <comma> already  almost  dead <period> and  what  i  then  found  out  about  what  's  called  the  e-patient  movement <comma> i  'll  explain  what  that  term  means <period> i  had  been  blogging  under  the  name  patient  dave <comma> and  when  i  discovered  this <comma> i  just  renamed  myself  e-patient  dave <period> regarding  the  word  patient <comma> when  i  first  started  a  few  years  ago  getting  involved  in  health  care  and  attending  meetings  as  just  a  casual  observer <comma> i  noticed  that  people  would  talk  about  patients  as  if  it  was  somebody  who  's  not  in  the  room  here <comma> somebody  out  there <period> some  of  our  talks  today <comma> we  still  act  like  that <period> but  i  'm  here  to  tell  you <comma> patient  is  not  a  third-person  word <period> you <comma> yourself <comma> will  find  yourself  in  a  hospital  bed <comma> or  your  mother <comma> your  child <comma> there  are  heads  nodding <comma> people  who  say <comma> yes <comma> i  know  exactly  what  you  mean <period> so  when  you  hear  what  i  'm  going  to  talk  about  here  today <comma> first  of  all <comma> i  want  to  say  that  i  am  here  on  behalf  of  all  the  patients  that  i  have  ever  met <comma> all  the  ones  i  have  n't  met <period> this  is  about  letting  patients  play  a  more  active  role  in  helping  health  care <comma> in  fixing  health  care <period> one  of  the  senior  doctors  at  my  hospital <comma> charlie  safran <comma> and  his  colleague <comma> warner  slack <comma> have  been  saying  for  decades  that  the  most  underutilized  resource  in  all  of  health  care  is  the  patient <period> they  have  been  saying  that  since  the  1970s <period> now  i  'm  going  to  step  back  in  history <period> this  is  from  july <comma> 1969 <period> i  was  a  freshman  in  college <comma> and  this  was  when  we  first  landed  on  the  moon <period> and  it  was  the  first  time  we  had  ever  seen  from  another  surface <comma> that  's  the  place  where  you  and  i  are  right  now <comma> where  we  live <period> the  world  was  changing <period> it  was  about  to  change  in  ways  that  nobody  could  foresee <period> a  few  weeks  later <comma> woodstock  happened <period> three  days  of  fun  and  music <period> here <comma> just  for  historical  authenticity <comma> is  a  picture  of  me  in  that  year <period> yeah <comma> the  wavy  hair <comma> the  blue  eyes <comma> it  was  really  something <period> that  fall  of  1969 <comma> the  whole  earth  catalog  came  out <period> it  was  a  hippie  journal  of  self-sufficiency <period> we  think  of  hippies  of  being  just  hedonists <comma> but  there  's  a  very  strong  component <comma> i  was  in  that  movement <comma> a  very  strong  component  of  being  responsible  for  yourself <period> this  book  's  title  's  subtitle  is <comma> access  to  tools <period> and  it  talked  about  how  to  build  your  own  house <comma> how  to  grow  your  own  food <comma> all  kinds  of  things <period> in  the  1980s <comma> this  doctor <comma> tom  ferguson <comma> was  the  medical  editor  of  the  whole  earth  catalog <period> and  he  saw  that  the  great  majority  of  what  we  do  in  medicine  and  health  care  is  taking  care  of  ourselves <period> in  fact <comma> he  said  it  was  70  to  80  percent  of  how  we  actually  take  care  of  our  bodies <period> well  he  also  saw  that  when  health  care  turns  to  medical  care  because  of  a  more  serious  disease <comma> the  key  thing  that  holds  us  back  is  access  to  information <period> and  when  the  web  came  along <comma> that  changed  everything <comma> because  not  only  could  we  find  information <comma> we  could  find  other  people  like  ourselves  who  could  gather <comma> who  could  bring  us  information <period> and  he  coined  this  term  e-patients <comma> equipped <comma> engaged <comma> empowered <comma> enabled <period> obviously  at  this  stage  of  life  he  was  in  a  somewhat  more  dignified  form  than  he  was  back  then <period> now  i  was  an  engaged  patient  long  before  i  ever  heard  of  the  term <period> in  2006 <comma> i  went  to  my  doctor  for  a  regular  physical <comma> and  i  had  said <comma> i  have  a  sore  shoulder <period> well <comma> i  got  an  x-ray <comma> and  the  next  morning <comma> you  may  have  noticed <comma> those  of  you  who  have  been  through  a  medical  crisis  will  understand  this <period> this  morning <comma> some  of  the  speakers  named  the  date  when  they  found  out  about  their  condition <period> for  me <comma> it  was  9:00  am  on  january  3 <comma> 2007 <period> i  was  at  the  office <period> my  desk  was  clean <period> i  had  the  blue  partition  carpet  on  the  walls <period> the  phone  rang  and  it  was  my  doctor <period> he  said <comma> dave <comma> i  pulled  up  the  x-ray  image  on  the  screen  on  the  computer  at  home <period> he  said <comma> your  shoulder  's  going  to  be  fine <comma> but  dave <comma> there  's  something  in  your  lung <period> and  if  you  look  in  that  red  oval <comma> that  shadow  was  not  supposed  to  be  there <period> to  make  a  long  story  short <comma> i  said <comma> so  you  need  me  to  get  back  in  there <questionmark> he  said <comma> yeah <comma> we  're  going  to  need  to  do  a  ct  scan  of  your  chest <period> and  in  parting  i  said <comma> is  there  anything  i  should  do <questionmark> he  said <comma> think  about  this  one <period> this  is  the  advice  your  doctor  gives  you <period> just  go  home  and  have  a  glass  of  wine  with  your  wife <period> i  went  in  for  the  cat  scan <comma> and  it  turns  out  there  were  five  of  these  things  in  both  my  lungs <period> so  at  that  point  we  knew  that  it  was  cancer <period> we  knew  it  was  n't  lung  cancer <period> that  meant  it  was  metastasized  from  somewhere <period> the  question  was <comma> where  from <questionmark> so  i  went  in  for  an  ultrasound <period> i  got  to  do  what  many  women  have <comma> the  jelly  on  the  belly  and  bzzzz <period> my  wife  came  with  me <period> she  's  a  veterinarian <comma> so  she  's  seen  lots  of  ultrasounds <period> i  mean <comma> she  knows  i  'm  not  a  dog <period> but  what  we  saw <comma> this  is  an  mri  image <period> this  is  much  sharper  than  an  ultrasound  would  be <period> what  we  saw  in  that  kidney  was  that  big  blob  there <period> and  there  were  actually  two  of  these <period> one  was  growing  out  the  front  and  it  had  already  erupted <comma> and  it  latched  onto  the  bowel <period> one  was  growing  out  the  back <comma> and  it  attached  to  the  soleus  muscle <comma> which  is  a  big  muscle  in  the  back  that  i'd  never  heard  of <comma> but  all  of  a  sudden  i  cared  about  it <period> i  went  home <period> now  i've  been  googling <comma> i've  been  online  since  1989  on  compuserv <period> i  went  home <comma> and  i  know  you  cannot  read  the  details  here <period> that  's  not  important <period> my  point  is  i  went  to  a  respected  medical  website <comma> webmd <comma> because  i  know  how  to  filter  out  junk <period> i  also  found  my  wife  online <period> before  i  met  her <comma> i  went  through  some  suboptimal  search  results <period> so  i  looked  for  quality  information <period> there  's  so  much  about  trust <comma> what  sources  of  information  can  we  trust <questionmark> where  does  my  body  end  and  an  invader  start <questionmark> and  cancer <comma> a  tumor <comma> is  something  you  grow  out  of  your  own  tissue <period> how  does  that  happen <questionmark> where  does  medical  ability  end  and  start <questionmark> well <comma> so  what  i  read  on  webmd <comma> the  prognosis  is  poor  for  progressing  renal  cell  cancer <period> almost  all  patients  are  incurable <period> i've  been  online  long  enough  to  know  if  i  do  n't  like  the  first  results  i  get <comma> i  go  look  for  more <period> and  what  i  found  was  on  other  websites <comma> even  by  the  third  page  of  google  results <comma> outlook  is  bleak <comma> prognosis  is  grim <period> and  i  'm  thinking <comma> what  the  heck <questionmark> i  did  n't  feel  sick  at  all <period> i  mean <comma> i'd  been  getting  tired  in  the  evening <comma> but  i  was  56  years-old <period> i  was  slowly  losing  weight <comma> but  for  me <comma> that  was  what  the  doctor  told  me  to  do <period> it  was  really  something <period> and  this  is  the  diagram  of  stage  four  kidney  cancer  from  the  drug  i  eventually  got <period> totally  by  coincidence <comma> there  's  that  thing  in  my  lung <period> in  the  left  femur <comma> the  left  thigh  bone <comma> there  's  another  one <period> i  had  one <period> my  leg  eventually  snapped <period> i  fainted  and  landed  on  it <comma> and  it  broke <period> there  's  one  in  the  skull <comma> and  then  just  for  good  measure <comma> i  had  these  other  tumors <comma> including <comma> by  the  time  my  treatment  started <comma> one  was  growing  out  of  my  tongue <period> i  had  kidney  cancer  growing  out  of  my  tongue <period> and  what  i  read  was  that  my  median  survival  was  24  weeks <period> this  was  bad <period> i  was  facing  the  grave <period> i  thought <comma> what  's  my  mother  's  face  going  to  look  like  on  the  day  of  my  funeral <questionmark> i  had  to  sit  down  with  my  daughter  and  say <comma> here  's  the  situation <period> her  boyfriend  was  with  her <period> i  said <comma> i  do  n't  want  you  guys  to  get  married  prematurely  just  so  you  can  do  it  while  dad  's  still  alive <period> it  's  really  serious <period> because  if  you  wonder  why  patients  are  motivated  and  want  to  help <comma> think  about  this <period> well <comma> my  doctor  prescribed  a  patient  community <comma> acororg <comma> a  network  of  cancer  patients <comma> of  all  amazing  things <period> very  quickly  they  told  me <comma> kidney  cancer  is  an  uncommon  disease <period> get  yourself  to  a  specialist  center <period> there  is  no  cure <comma> but  there  's  something  that  sometimes  works <comma> it  usually  does  n't <comma> called  high-dosage  interleukin <period> most  hospitals  do  n't  offer  it <comma> so  they  wo  n't  even  tell  you  it  exists <period> and  do  n't  let  them  give  you  anything  else  first <period> and  by  the  way <comma> here  are  four  doctors  in  your  part  of  the  united  states  who  offer  it  and  their  phone  numbers <period> how  amazing  is  that <questionmark> here  's  the  thing <period> here  we  are <comma> four  years  later <comma> you  cannot  find  a  website  that  gives  patients  that  information <period> government  approved <comma> american  cancer  society <comma> but  patients  know  what  patients  want  to  know <period> it  's  the  power  of  patient  networks <period> this  amazing  substance <comma> again  i  mentioned <comma> where  does  my  body  end <questionmark> my  oncologist  and  i  talk  a  lot  these  days <comma> because  i  try  to  keep  my  talks  technically  accurate <period> and  he  said <comma> you  know <comma> the  immune  system  is  good  at  detecting  invaders <comma> bacteria  coming  from  outside <comma> but  when  it  's  your  own  tissue  that  you've  grown <comma> it  's  a  whole  different  thing <period> and  i  went  through  a  mental  exercise  actually <comma> because  i  started  a  patient  support  community  of  my  own  on  a  website <comma> and  one  of  my  friends <comma> one  of  my  relatives  actually <comma> said <comma> look <comma> dave <comma> who  grew  this  thing <questionmark> are  you  going  to  set  yourself  up  as  mentally  attacking  yourself <questionmark> so  we  went  into  it <period> and  the  story  of  how  all  that  happens  is  in  this  book <period> anyway <comma> this  is  the  way  the  numbers  unfolded <period> me  being  me <comma> i  put  the  numbers  from  my  hospital  's  website  from  my  tumor  sizes  into  a  spreadsheet <period> do  n't  worry  about  the  numbers <period> you  see <comma> that  's  the  immune  system <period> amazing  thing <comma> those  two  yellow  lines  are  where  i  got  the  two  doses  of  interleukin  two  months  apart <period> and  look  at  how  the  tumor  sizes  plummeted  in  between <period> just  incredible <period> who  knows  what  we  'll  be  able  to  do  when  we  learn  to  make  more  use  of  it <period> the  punch  line  is  that  a  year  and  a  half  later <comma> i  was  there  when  this  magnificent  young  woman <comma> my  daughter <comma> got  married <period> and  when  she  came  down  those  steps <comma> and  it  was  just  her  and  me  for  that  moment <comma> i  was  so  glad  that  she  did  n't  have  to  say  to  her  mother <comma> i  wish  dad  could  have  been  here <period> and  this  is  what  we  're  doing  when  we  make  health  care  better <period> now  i  want  to  talk  briefly  about  a  couple  of  other  patients  who  are  doing  everything  in  their  power  to  improve  health  care <period> this  is  regina  holliday <comma> a  painter  in  washington  dc <comma> whose  husband  died  of  kidney  cancer  a  year  after  my  disease <period> she  's  painting  here  a  mural  of  his  horrible  final  weeks  in  the  hospital <period> one  of  the  things  that  she  discovered  was  that  her  husband  's  medical  record  in  this  paper  folder  was  just  disorganized <period> and  she  thought <comma> you  know <comma> if  i  have  a  nutrition  facts  label  on  the  side  of  a  cereal  box <comma> why  cannot  there  be  something  that  simple  telling  every  new  nurse  who  comes  on  duty <comma> every  new  doctor <comma> the  basics  about  my  husband  's  condition <questionmark> so  she  painted  this  medical  facts  mural  with  a  nutrition  label <comma> something  like  that <comma> in  a  diagram  of  him <period> she  then <comma> last  year <comma> painted  this  diagram <period> she  studied  health  care  like  me <period> she  came  to  realize  that  there  were  a  lot  of  people  who'd  written  patient  advocate  books  that  you  just  do  n't  hear  about  at  medical  conferences <period> patients  are  such  an  underutilized  resource <period> well  as  it  says  in  my  introduction <comma> i've  got  somewhat  know  for  saying  that  patients  should  have  access  to  their  data <period> and  i  actually  said  at  one  conference  a  couple  of  years  ago <comma> give  me  my  damn  data <comma> because  you  people  cannot  be  trusted  to  keep  it  clean <period> and  hear  she  has  our  dammed  data <comma> it  's  a  pun <comma> which  is  starting  to  break  out <comma> starting  to  break  through <comma> the  water  symbolizes  our  data <period> and  in  fact <comma> i  want  to  do  a  little  something  improvisational  for  you  here <period> there  's  a  guy  on  twitter  that  i  know <comma> a  health  it  guy  outside  boston <comma> and  he  wrote  the  e-patient  rap <period> and  it  goes  like  this <period> gimme  my  damn  data  i  want  to  be  an  e-patient  just  like  dave  gimme  my  damn  data <comma> cuz  it  's  my  life  to  save  now  i  'm  not  going  to  go  any  further <period> well  thank  you <period> that  shot  the  timing <period> think  about  the  possibility <comma> why  is  it  that  iphones  and  ipads  advance  far  faster  than  the  health  tools  that  are  available  to  you  to  help  take  care  of  your  family <questionmark> here  's  a  website <comma> visiblebodycom <comma> that  i  stumbled  across <period> and  i  thought <comma> you  know <comma> i  wonder  what  my  soleus  muscle  is <questionmark> so  you  can  click  on  things  and  remove  it <period> and  i  saw <comma> aha <comma> that  's  the  kidney  and  the  soleus  muscle <period> and  i  was  rotating  it  in  3d  and  saying <comma> i  understand  now <period> and  then  i  realized  it  reminded  me  of  google  earth <comma> where  you  can  fly  to  any  address <period> and  i  thought <comma> why  not  take  this  and  connect  it  to  my  digital  scan  data  and  have  google  earth  for  my  body <questionmark> what  did  google  come  out  with  this  year <questionmark> now  there  's  google  body  browser <period> but  you  see <comma> it  's  still  generic <period> it  's  not  my  data <period> but  if  we  can  get  that  data  out  from  behind  the  dam  so  software  innovators  can  pounce  on  it <comma> the  way  software  innovators  like  to  do <comma> who  knows  what  we  'll  be  able  to  come  up  with <period> one  final  story <comma> this  is  kelly  young <comma> a  rheumatoid  arthritis  patient  from  florida <period> this  is  a  live  story  unfolding  just  in  the  last  few  weeks <period> ra  patients <comma> as  they  call  themselves <comma> her  blog  is  ra  warrior <comma> have  a  big  problem  because  40  percent  of  them  have  no  visible  symptoms <period> and  that  makes  it  just  really  hard  to  tell  how  the  disease  is  going <period> and  some  doctors  think <comma> yeah  right <comma> you  're  really  in  pain <period> well  she  found <comma> through  her  online  research <comma> a  nuclear  bone  scan  that  's  usually  used  for  cancer <comma> but  it  can  also  reveal  inflammation <period> and  she  saw  that  if  there  is  no  inflammation  then  the  scan  is  a  uniform  gray <period> so  she  took  it <period> and  the  radiologist  report  said <comma> no  cancer  found <period> well  that  's  not  what  he  was  supposed  to  do  with  it <period> so  she  had  it  read  again <comma> she  wanted  to  have  it  read  again <comma> and  her  doctor  fired  her <period> she  pulled  up  the  cd <period> he  said <comma> if  you  do  n't  want  to  follow  my  instructions <comma> go  away <period> so  she  pulled  up  the  cd  of  the  scan  images <comma> and  look  at  all  those  hot  spots <period> and  she  's  now  actively  engaged  on  her  blog  in  looking  for  assistance  in  getting  better  care <period> see <comma> that  is  an  empowered  patient <comma> no  medical  training <period> we  are <comma> you  are <comma> the  most  underused  resource  in  health  care <period> what  she  was  able  to  do  was  because  she  had  access  to  the  raw  data <period> how  big  a  deal  was  this <questionmark> well  at  ted2009 <comma> tim  berners-lee  himself <comma> inventor  of  the  web <comma> gave  a  talk  where  he  said  the  next  big  thing  is  not  to  have  your  browser  go  out  and  find  other  people  's  articles  about  the  data <comma> but  the  raw  data <period> and  he  got  them  chanting  by  the  end  of  the  talk <comma> raw  data  now <period> raw  data  now <period> and  i  ask  you <comma> three  words <comma> please <comma> to  improve  health  care <comma> let  patients  help <period> let  patients  help <period> let  patients  help <period> let  patients  help <period> thank  you <period> for  all  the  patients  around  the  world  watching  this  on  the  webcast <comma> god  bless  you <comma> everyone <comma> let  patients  help <period> and  bless  yourself <period> thank  you  very  much <period> by  birth  and  by  choice <comma> i've  been  involved  with  the  auto  industry  my  entire  life <comma> and  for  the  past  30  years <comma> i've  worked  at  ford  motor  company <period> and  for  most  of  those  years <comma> i've  worried  about <comma> how  am  i  going  to  sell  more  cars  and  trucks <questionmark> but  today  i  worry  about <comma> what  if  all  we  do  is  sell  more  cars  and  trucks <questionmark> what  happens  when  the  number  of  vehicles  on  the  road  doubles <comma> triples <comma> or  even  quadruples <questionmark> my  life  is  guided  by  two  great  passions <comma> and  the  first  is  automobiles <period> i  literally  grew  up  with  the  ford  motor  company <period> i  thought  it  was  so  cool  as  a  little  boy  when  my  dad  would  bring  home  the  latest  ford  or  lincoln  and  leave  it  in  the  driveway <period> and  i  decided  about  that  time <comma> about  age  10 <comma> that  it  would  be  really  cool  if  i  was  a  test  driver <period> so  my  parents  would  go  to  dinner <period> they'd  sit  down <comma> i'd  sneak  out  of  the  house <period> i'd  jump  behind  the  wheel  and  take  the  new  model  around  the  driveway <comma> and  it  was  a  blast <period> and  that  went  on  for  about  two  years <comma> until <comma> i  think  i  was  about  12 <comma> my  dad  brought  home  a  lincoln  mark  iii <period> and  it  was  snowing  that  day <period> so  he  and  mom  went  to  dinner <period> and  i  snuck  out  and  thought  it'd  be  really  cool  to  do  donuts  or  even  some  figure-eights  in  the  snow <period> my  dad  finished  dinner  early  that  evening <period> and  he  was  walking  to  the  front  hall  and  out  the  front  door  just  about  the  same  time  i  hit  some  ice  and  met  him  at  the  front  door  with  the  car <comma> and  almost  ended  up  in  the  front  hall <period> so  it  kind  of  cooled  my  test  driving  for  a  little  while <period> but  i  really  began  to  love  cars  then <period> and  my  first  car  was  a  1975  electric-green  mustang <period> and  even  though  the  color  was  pretty  hideous <comma> i  did  love  the  car <comma> and  it  really  cemented  my  love  affair  with  cars  that  's  continued  on  to  this  day <period> but  cars  are  really  more  than  a  passion  of  mine <period> they  quite  literally  in  my  blood <period> my  great  grandfather  was  henry  ford <comma> and  on  my  mother  's  side <comma> my  great  grandfather  was  harvey  firestone <period> so  when  i  was  born <comma> i  guess  you  could  say  expectations  were  kind  of  high  for  me <period> but  my  great  grandfather <comma> henry  ford <comma> really  believed  that  the  mission  of  the  ford  motor  company  was  to  make  people  's  lives  better  and  make  cars  affordable  so  that  everyone  could  have  them <period> because  he  believed  that <comma> with  mobility <comma> comes  freedom  and  progress <period> and  that  's  a  belief  that  i  share <period> my  other  great  passion  is  the  environment <period> and  as  a  young  boy <comma> i  used  to  go  up  to  northern  michigan  and  fish  in  the  rivers  that  hemingway  fished  in  and  then  later  wrote  about <period> and  it  really  struck  me  as  the  years  went  by <comma> in  a  very  negative  way <comma> when  i  would  go  to  some  stream  that  i'd  loved <comma> and  was  used  to  walking  through  this  field  that  was  once  filled  with  fireflies <comma> and  now  had  a  strip  mall  or  a  bunch  of  condos  on  it <period> and  so  even  at  a  young  age <comma> that  really  resonated  with  me <period> and  the  whole  notion  of  environmental  preservation <comma> at  a  very  basic  level <comma> sunk  in  with  me <period> as  a  high-schooler <comma> i  started  to  read  authors  like  thoreau  and  aldo  leopold  and  edward  abbey <period> and  i  really  began  to  develop  a  deeper  appreciation  of  the  natural  world <period> but  it  never  really  occurred  to  me  that  my  love  of  cars  and  trucks  would  ever  be  in  conflict  with  nature <period> and  that  was  true  until  i  got  to  college <period> and  when  i  got  to  college <comma> you  can  imagine  my  surprise  when  i  would  go  to  class  and  a  number  of  my  professors  would  say  that  ford  motor  company  and  my  family  was  everything  that  was  wrong  with  our  country <period> they  thought  that  we  were  more  interested <comma> as  an  industry <comma> in  profits <comma> rather  than  progress <comma> and  that  we  filled  the  skies  with  smog <comma> and  frankly <comma> we  were  the  enemy <period> i  joined  ford  after  college <comma> after  some  soul  searching  whether  or  not  this  is  really  the  right  thing  to  do <period> but  i  decided  that  i  wanted  to  go  and  see  if  i  could  affect  change  there <period> and  as  i  look  back  over  30  years  ago <comma> it  was  a  little  naive  to  think  at  that  age  that  i  could <comma> but  i  wanted  to <period> and  i  really  discovered  that  my  professors  were  n't  completely  wrong <period> in  fact <comma> when  i  got  back  to  detroit <comma> my  environmental  leanings  were  n't  exactly  embraced  by  those  in  my  own  company <comma> and  certainly  by  those  in  the  industry <period> i  had  some  very  interesting  conversations <comma> as  you  can  imagine <period> there  were  some  within  ford  who  believed  that  all  this  ecological  nonsense  should  just  disappear  and  that  i  needed  to  stop  hanging  out  with  environmental  wackos <period> i  was  considered  a  radical <period> and  i  'll  never  forget  the  day  i  was  called  in  by  a  member  of  top  management  and  told  to  stop  associating  with  any  known  or  suspected  environmentalists <period> of  course <comma> i  had  no  intention  of  doing  that <period> and  i  kept  speaking  out  about  the  environment <period> and  it  really  was  the  topic  that  we  now  today  sustainability <period> and  in  time <comma> my  views  went  from  controversial  to  more  or  less  consensus  today <period> i  mean <comma> i  think  most  people  in  the  industry  understand  that  we've  got  to  get  on  with  it <period> and  the  good  news  is  today  we  are  tackling  the  big  issues <comma> of  cars  and  the  environment <comma> not  only  at  ford <comma> but  really  as  an  industry <period> we  're  pushing  fuel  efficiency  to  new  heights <period> and  with  new  technology <comma> we  're  reducing <comma> and  i  believe <comma> someday  will  eliminate <comma> co2  emissions <period> we  're  starting  to  sell  electric  cars <comma> which  is  great <period> we  're  developing  alternative  power  trains  that  are  going  to  make  cars  affordable  in  every  sense  of  the  word <comma> economically <comma> socially  and  environmentally <period> and  actually <comma> although  we've  got  a  long  way  to  go  and  a  lot  of  work  to  do <comma> i  can  see  the  day  where  my  two  great  passions <comma> cars  and  the  environment <comma> actually  come  into  harmony <period> but  unfortunately <comma> as  we  're  on  our  way  to  solving  one  monstrous  problem <comma> and  as  i  said <comma> we  're  not  there  yet <period> we've  got  a  lot  of  work  to  do <comma> but  i  can  see  where  we  will <comma> but  even  as  we  're  in  the  process  of  doing  that <comma> another  huge  problem  is  looming <comma> and  people  are  n't  noticing <period> and  that  is  the  freedom  of  mobility  that  my  great  grandfather  brought  to  people  is  now  being  threatened <comma> just  as  the  environment  is <period> the  problem <comma> put  in  its  simplest  terms <comma> is  one  of  mathematics <period> today  there  are  approximately  68  billion  people  in  the  world <period> and  within  our  lifetime <comma> that  number  's  going  to  grow  to  about  nine  billion <period> and  at  that  population  level <comma> our  planet  will  be  dealing  with  the  limits  of  growth <period> and  with  that  growth  comes  some  severe  practical  problems <comma> one  of  which  is  our  transportation  system  simply  wo  n't  be  able  to  deal  with  it <period> when  we  look  at  the  population  growth  in  terms  of  cars <comma> it  becomes  even  clearer <period> today  there  are  about  800  million  cars  on  the  road  worldwide <period> but  with  more  people  and  greater  prosperity  around  the  world <comma> that  number  's  going  to  grow  to  between  two  and  four  billion  cars  by  mid  century <period> and  this  is  going  to  create  the  kind  of  global  gridlock  that  the  world  has  never  seen  before <period> now  think  about  the  impact  that  this  is  going  to  have  on  our  daily  lives <period> today  the  average  american  spends  about  a  week  a  year  stuck  in  traffic  jams <period> and  that  's  a  huge  waste  of  time  and  resources <period> but  that  's  nothing  compared  to  what  's  going  on  in  the  nations  that  are  growing  the  fastest <period> today  the  average  driver  in  beijing  has  a  five-hour  commute <period> and  last  summer <comma> many  of  you  probably  saw  this <comma> there  was  a  hundred-mile  traffic  jam  that  took  11  days  to  clear  in  china <period> in  the  decades  to  come <comma> 75  percent  of  the  world  's  population  will  live  in  cities <comma> and  50  of  those  cities  will  be  of  10  million  people  or  more <period> so  you  can  see  the  size  of  the  issue  that  we  're  facing <period> when  you  factor  in  population  growth <comma> it  's  clear  that  mobility  model  that  we  have  today  simply  will  not  work  tomorrow <period> frankly <comma> four  billion  clean  cars  on  the  road  are  still  four  billion  cars <period> and  a  traffic  jam  with  no  emissions  is  still  a  traffic  jam <period> so <comma> if  we  make  no  changes  today <comma> what  does  tomorrow  look  like <questionmark> well  i  think  you  probably  already  have  the  picture <period> traffic  jams  are  just  a  symptom  of  this  challenge <comma> and  they  're  really  very <comma> very  inconvenient <comma> but  that  's  all  they  are <period> but  the  bigger  issue  is  that  global  gridlock  is  going  to  stifle  economic  growth  and  our  ability  to  deliver  food  and  health  care <comma> particularly  to  people  that  live  in  city  centers <period> and  our  quality  of  life  is  going  to  be  severely  compromised <period> so  what  's  going  to  solve  this <questionmark> well  the  answer  is  n't  going  to  be  more  of  the  same <period> my  great  grandfather  once  said  before  he  invented  the  model  t <comma> if  i  had  asked  people  then  what  they  wanted <comma> they  would  have  answered <comma> we  want  faster  horses  so  the  answer  to  more  cars  is  simply  not  to  have  more  roads <period> when  america  began  moving  west <comma> we  did  n't  add  more  wagon  trains <comma> we  built  railroads <period> and  to  connect  our  country  after  world  war  ii <comma> we  did  n't  build  more  two-lane  highways <comma> we  built  the  interstate  highway  system <period> today  we  need  that  same  leap  in  thinking  for  us  to  create  a  viable  future <period> we  are  going  to  build  smart  cars <comma> but  we  also  need  to  build  smart  roads <comma> smart  parking <comma> smart  public  transportation  systems  and  more <period> we  do  n't  want  to  waste  our  time  sitting  in  traffic <comma> sitting  at  toll  booths  or  looking  for  parking  spots <period> we  need  an  integrated  system  that  uses  real  time  data  to  optimize  personal  mobility  on  a  massive  scale  without  hassle  or  compromises  for  travelers <period> and  frankly <comma> that  's  the  kind  of  system  that  's  going  to  make  the  future  of  personal  mobility  sustainable <period> now  the  good  news  is  some  of  this  work  has  already  begun  in  different  parts  of  the  world <period> the  city  of  masdar  in  abu  dhabi  uses  driverless  electric  vehicles  that  can  communicate  with  one  another <comma> and  they  go  underneath  the  city  streets <period> and  up  above <comma> you've  got  a  series  of  pedestrian  walkways <period> on  new  york  city  's  34th  st <comma> gridlock  will  soon  be  replaced  with  a  connected  system  of  vehicle-specific  corridors <period> pedestrian  zones  and  dedicated  traffic  lanes  are  going  to  be  created <comma> and  all  of  this  will  cut  down  the  average  rush  hour  commute  to  get  across  town  in  new  york  from  about  an  hour  today  at  rush  hour  to  about  20  minutes <period> now  if  you  look  at  hong  kong <comma> they  have  a  very  interesting  system  called  octopus  there <period> it  's  a  system  that  really  ties  together  all  the  transportation  assets  into  a  single  payment  system <period> so  parking  garages <comma> buses <comma> trains <comma> they  all  operate  within  the  same  system <period> now  shared  car  services  are  also  springing  up  around  the  world <period> and  these  efforts <comma> i  think <comma> are  great <period> they  're  relieving  congestion <comma> and  they  're  frankly  starting  to  save  some  fuel <period> these  are  all  really  good  ideas  that  will  move  us  forward <period> but  what  really  inspires  me  is  what  's  going  to  be  possible  when  our  cars  can  begin  talking  to  each  other <period> very  soon <comma> the  same  systems  that  we  use  today  to  bring  music  and  entertainment  and  gps  information  into  our  vehicles  are  going  to  be  used  to  create  a  smart  vehicle  network <period> every  morning  i  drive  about  30  miles  from  my  home  in  ann  arbor  to  my  office  in  dearborn <comma> michigan <period> and  every  night  i  go  home <comma> my  commute  is  a  total  crap  shoot <period> and  i  often  have  to  leave  the  freeway  and  look  for  different  ways  for  me  to  try  and  make  it  home <period> but  very  soon  we  're  going  to  see  the  days  when  cars  are  essentially  talking  to  each  other <period> so  if  the  car  ahead  of  me  on  i-94  hits  traffic <comma> it  will  immediately  alert  my  car  and  tell  my  car  to  reroute  itself  to  get  me  home  in  the  best  possible  way <period> and  these  systems  are  being  tested  right  now <comma> and  frankly  they  're  going  to  be  ready  for  prime  time  pretty  soon <period> but  the  potential  of  a  connected  car  network  is  almost  limitless <period> one  day  very  soon <comma> you  're  going  to  be  able  to  plan  a  trip  downtown  and  your  car  will  be  connected  to  a  smart  parking  system <period> so  you  get  in  your  car <comma> and  as  you  get  in  your  car <comma> your  car  will  reserve  you  a  parking  spot  before  you  arrive <comma> no  more  driving  around  looking  for  one <comma> which  frankly  is  one  of  the  biggest  users  of  fuel  in  today  's  cars  in  urban  areas  is  looking  for  parking  spots <period> or  think  about  being  in  new  york  city  and  tracking  down  an  intelligent  cab  on  your  smart  phone  so  you  do  n't  have  to  wait  in  the  cold  to  hail  one <period> or  being  at  a  future  ted  conference  and  having  your  car  talk  to  the  calendars  of  everybody  here  and  telling  you  all  the  best  route  to  take  home  and  when  you  should  leave <comma> so  that  you  can  all  arrive  at  your  next  destination  on  time <period> this  is  the  kind  of  technology  that  will  merge  millions  of  individual  vehicles  into  a  single  system <period> so  i  think  it  's  clear  we  have  the  beginnings  of  a  solution  to  this  enormous  problem <period> but  as  we  found  out  with  addressing  co2  issues <comma> and  also  fossil  fuels <comma> there  is  no  one  silver  bullet <period> the  solution  is  not  going  to  be  more  cars <comma> more  roads  or  a  new  rail  system <period> it  can  only  be  found <comma> i  believe <comma> in  a  global  network  of  interconnected  solutions <period> now  i  know  we  can  develop  the  technology  that  's  going  to  make  this  work <comma> but  we've  got  to  be  willing  to  get  out  there  and  seek  out  the  solutions <comma> whether  that  means  vehicle  sharing  or  public  transportation  or  some  other  way  we  have  n't  even  thought  of  yet <comma> our  overall  transportation  mix  and  infrastructure  must  support  all  the  future  options <period> we  need  our  best  and  our  brightest  to  start  entertaining  this  issue <period> companies <comma> entrepreneurs <comma> venture  capitalists <comma> they  all  need  to  understand  this  is  a  huge  business  opportunity <comma> as  well  as  an  enormous  social  problem <period> and  just  as  these  groups  embrace  the  green  energy  challenge <comma> and  it  's  really  been  amazing  to  me  to  watch  how  much  brain  power <comma> how  much  money  and  how  much  serious  thought  has <comma> really  over  the  last  three  years <comma> just  poured  into  the  green  energy  field <period> we  need  that  same  kind  of  passion  and  energy  to  attack  global  gridlock <period> but  we  need  people  like  all  of  you  in  this  room <comma> leading  thinkers <period> i  mean <comma> frankly  i  need  all  of  you  to  think  about  how  you  can  help  solve  this  huge  issue <period> and  we  need  people  from  all  walks  of  life <period> not  just  inventors <comma> we  need  policymakers  and  government  officials  to  also  think  about  how  they  're  going  to  respond  to  this  challenge <period> this  is  n't  going  to  be  solved  by  any  one  person  or  one  group <period> it  's  going  to  really  require  a  national  energy  policy <comma> frankly  for  each  country <comma> because  the  solutions  in  each  country  are  going  to  be  different  based  upon  income  levels <comma> traffic  jams  and  also  how  integrated  the  systems  already  are <period> but  we  need  to  get  going <comma> and  we  need  to  get  going  today <period> and  we  must  have  an  infrastructure  that  's  designed  to  support  this  flexible  future <period> you  know <comma> we've  come  a  long  way <period> since  the  model  t <comma> most  people  never  traveled  more  than  25  miles  from  home  in  their  entire  life  time <period> and  since  then <comma> the  automobile  has  allowed  us  the  freedom  to  choose  where  we  live <comma> where  we  work <comma> where  we  play  and  frankly  when  we  just  go  out  and  want  to  move  around <period> we  do  n't  want  to  regress  and  lose  that  freedom <period> we  're  on  our  way  to  solving <comma> and  as  i  said  earlier <comma> i  know  we've  got  a  long  way  to  go <comma> the  one  big  issue  that  we  're  all  focused  on  that  threatens  it <comma> and  that  's  the  environmental  issue <comma> but  i  believe  we  all  must  turn  all  of  our  effort  and  all  of  our  ingenuity  and  determination  to  help  now  solve  this  notion  of  global  gridlock <period> because  in  doing  so <comma> we  're  going  to  preserve  what  we've  really  come  to  take  for  granted <comma> which  is  the  freedom  to  move  and  move  very  effortlessly  around  the  world <period> and  it  frankly  will  enhance  our  quality  of  life  if  we  fix  this <period> because <comma> if  you  can  envision <comma> as  i  do <comma> a  future  of  zero  emissions  and  freedom  to  move  around  the  country  and  around  the  world  like  we  take  for  granted  today <comma> that  's  worth  the  hard  work  today  to  preserve  that  for  tomorrow <period> i  believe  we  're  at  our  best  when  we  're  confronted  with  big  issues <period> this  is  a  big  one <comma> and  it  wo  n't  wait <period> so  let  's  get  started  now <period> thank  you <period> the  highline  is  an  old <comma> elevated  rail  line  that  runs  for  a  mile  and  a  half  right  through  manhattan <period> and  it  was  originally  a  freight  line  that  ran  down  10th  ave <period> and  it  became  known  as  death  avenue  because  so  many  people  were  run  over  by  the  trains  that  the  railroad  hired  a  guy  on  horseback  to  run  in  front <comma> and  he  became  known  as  the  west  side  cowboy <period> but  even  with  a  cowboy <comma> about  one  person  a  month  was  killed  and  run  over <period> so  they  elevated  it <period> they  built  it  30  ft <period> in  the  air <comma> right  through  the  middle  of  the  city <period> but  with  the  rise  of  interstate  trucking <comma> it  was  used  less  and  less <period> and  by  1980 <comma> the  last  train  rode <period> it  was  a  train  loaded  with  frozen  turkeys <comma> they  say <comma> at  thanksgiving <comma> from  the  meatpacking  district <period> and  then  it  was  abandoned <period> and  i  live  in  the  neighborhood <comma> and  i  first  read  about  it  in  the  new  york  times <comma> in  an  article  that  said  it  was  going  to  be  demolished <period> and  i  assumed  someone  was  working  to  preserve  it  or  save  it  and  i  could  volunteer <comma> but  i  realized  no  one  was  doing  anything <period> i  went  to  my  first  community  board  meeting <comma> which  i'd  never  been  to  one  before <comma> and  sat  next  to  another  guy  named  joshua  david <comma> who  's  a  travel  writer <period> and  at  the  end  of  the  meeting <comma> we  realized  we  were  the  only  two  people  that  were  sort  of  interested  in  the  project <period> most  people  wanted  to  tear  it  down <period> so  we  exchanged  business  cards <comma> and  we  kept  calling  each  other  and  decided  to  start  this  organization <comma> friends  of  the  high  line <period> and  the  goal  at  first  was  just  saving  it  from  demolition <comma> but  then  we  also  wanted  to  figure  out  what  we  could  do  with  it <period> and  what  first  attracted  me <comma> or  interested  me <comma> was  this  view  from  the  street <comma> which  is  this  steel  structure <comma> sort  of  rusty <comma> this  industrial  relic <period> but  when  i  went  up  on  top <comma> it  was  a  mile  and  a  half  of  wildflowers  running  right  through  the  middle  of  manhattan  with  views  of  the  empire  state  building  and  the  statue  of  liberty  and  the  hudson  river <period> and  that  's  really  where  we  started <comma> the  idea  coalesced  around <comma> let  's  make  this  a  park <comma> and  let  's  have  it  be  sort  of  inspired  by  this  wildscape <period> at  the  time <comma> there  was  a  lot  of  opposition <period> mayor  giuliani  wanted  to  tear  it  down <period> i  'm  going  to  fast-forward  through  a  lot  of  lawsuits  and  a  lot  of  community  engagement <period> mayor  bloomberg  came  in  office <comma> he  was  very  supportive <comma> but  we  still  had  to  make  the  economic  case <period> this  was  after  9/11 <period> the  city  was  in  tough  times <period> so  we  commissioned  an  economic  feasibility  study  to  try  to  make  the  case <period> and  it  turns  out <comma> we  got  those  numbers  wrong <period> we  thought  it  would  cost  100  million  dollars  to  build <period> so  far  it  's  cost  about  150  million <period> and  the  main  case  was <comma> this  is  going  to  make  good  economic  sense  for  the  city <period> so  we  said  over  a  20-year  time  period <comma> the  value  to  the  city  in  increased  property  values  and  increased  taxes  would  be  about  250  million <period> that  was  enough <period> it  really  got  the  city  behind  it <period> it  turns  out  we  were  wrong  on  that <period> now  people  estimate  it  's  created  about  a  half  a  billion  dollars <comma> or  will  create  about  a  half  a  billion  dollars <comma> in  tax  revenues  for  the  city <period> we  did  a  design  competition <comma> selected  a  design  team <period> we  worked  with  them  to  really  create  a  design  that  was  inspired  by  that  wildscape <period> there  's  three  sections <period> we  opened  the  fist  section  in  2009 <period> it  's  been  successful  beyond  our  dreams <period> last  year  we  had  about  two  million  people <comma> which  is  about  10  times  what  we  ever  estimated <period> this  is  one  of  my  favorite  features  in  section  one <period> it  's  this  amphitheater  right  over  10th  ave <period> and  the  first  section  ends  at  20th  st <period> right  now <period> the  other  thing <comma> it  's  generated <comma> obviously <comma> a  lot  of  economic  value <period> it  's  also  inspired <comma> i  think <comma> a  lot  of  great  architecture <period> there  's  a  point <comma> you  can  stand  here  and  see  buildings  by  frank  gehry <comma> jean  nouvel <comma> shigeru  ban <comma> neil  denari <period> and  the  whitney  is  moving  downtown  and  is  building  their  new  museum  right  at  the  base  of  the  high  line <period> and  this  has  been  designed  by  renzo  piano <period> and  they  're  going  to  break  ground  in  may <period> and  we've  already  started  construction  on  section  two <period> this  is  one  of  my  favorite  features <comma> this  flyover  where  you  're  eight  feet  off  the  surface  of  the  high  line <comma> running  through  a  canopy  of  trees <period> the  high  line  used  to  be  covered  in  billboards <comma> and  so  we've  taken  a  playful  take  where <comma> instead  of  framing  advertisements <comma> it  's  going  to  frame  people  in  views  of  the  city <period> this  was  just  installed  last  month <period> and  then  the  last  section  was  going  to  go  around  the  rail  yards <comma> which  is  the  largest  undeveloped  site  in  manhattan <period> and  the  city  has  planned <comma> for  better  or  for  worse <comma> 12  million  square-feet  of  development  that  the  high  line  is  going  to  ring  around <period> but  what  really <comma> i  think <comma> makes  the  high  line  special  is  the  people <period> and  honestly <comma> even  though  i  love  the  designs  that  we  were  building <comma> i  was  always  frightened  that  i  would  n't  really  love  it <comma> because  i  fell  in  love  with  that  wildscape <comma> and  how  could  you  recreate  that  magic <questionmark> but  what  i  found  is  it  's  in  the  people  and  how  they  use  it  that <comma> to  me <comma> makes  it  so  special <period> just  one  quick  example  is  i  realized  right  after  we  opened  that  there  were  all  these  people  holding  hands  on  the  high  line <period> and  i  realized  new  yorkers  do  n't  hold  hands <period> we  just  do  n't  do  that  outside <period> but  you  see  that  happening  on  the  high  line <comma> and  i  think  that  's  the  power  that  public  space  can  have  to  transform  how  people  experience  their  city  and  interact  with  each  other <period> thanks <period> a  few  years  ago <comma> i  felt  like  i  was  stuck  in  a  rut <comma> so  i  decided  to  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  the  great  american  philosopher <comma> morgan  spurlock <comma> and  try  something  new  for  30  days <period> the  idea  is  actually  pretty  simple <period> think  about  something  you've  always  wanted  to  add  to  your  life  and  try  it  for  the  next  30  days <period> it  turns  out <comma> 30  days  is  just  about  the  right  amount  of  time  to  add  a  new  habit  or  subtract  a  habit <comma> like  watching  the  news <comma> from  your  life <period> there  's  a  few  things  i  learned  while  doing  these  30-day  challenges <period> the  first  was <comma> instead  of  the  months  flying  by <comma> forgotten <comma> the  time  was  much  more  memorable <period> this  was  part  of  a  challenge  i  did  to  take  a  picture  everyday  for  a  month <period> and  i  remember  exactly  where  i  was  and  what  i  was  doing  that  day <period> i  also  noticed  that  as  i  started  to  do  more  and  harder  30-day  challenges <comma> my  self-confidence  grew <period> i  went  from  desk-dwelling  computer  nerd  to  the  kind  of  guy  who  bikes  to  work <comma> for  fun <period> even  last  year <comma> i  ended  up  hiking  up  mt <period> kilimanjaro <comma> the  highest  mountain  in  africa <period> i  would  never  have  been  that  adventurous  before  i  started  my  30-day  challenges <period> i  also  figured  out  that  if  you  really  want  something  badly  enough <comma> you  can  do  anything  for  30  days <period> have  you  ever  wanted  to  write  a  novel <questionmark> every  november <comma> tens  of  thousands  of  people  try  to  write  their  own  50,000  word  novel  from  scratch  in  30  days <period> it  turns  out <comma> all  you  have  to  do  is  write  1,667  words  a  day  for  a  month <period> so  i  did <period> by  the  way <comma> the  secret  is  not  to  go  to  sleep  until  you've  written  your  words  for  the  day <period> you  might  be  sleep-deprived <comma> but  you  'll  finish  your  novel <period> now  is  my  book  the  next  great  american  novel <questionmark> no <period> i  wrote  it  in  a  month <period> it  's  awful <period> but  for  the  rest  of  my  life <comma> if  i  meet  john  hodgman  at  a  ted  party <comma> i  do  n't  have  to  say <comma> i  'm  a  computer  scientist <period> no <comma> no <comma> if  i  want  to  i  can  say <comma> i  'm  a  novelist <period> so  here  's  one  last  thing  i'd  like  to  mention <period> i  learned  that  when  i  made  small <comma> sustainable  changes <comma> things  i  could  keep  doing <comma> they  were  more  likely  to  stick <period> there  's  nothing  wrong  with  big <comma> crazy  challenges <period> in  fact <comma> they  're  a  ton  of  fun <period> but  they  're  less  likely  to  stick <period> when  i  gave  up  sugar  for  30  days <comma> day  31  looked  like  this <period> so  here  's  my  question  to  you <comma> what  are  you  waiting  for <questionmark> i  guarantee  you  the  next  30  days  are  going  to  pass  whether  you  like  it  or  not <comma> so  why  not  think  about  something  you  have  always  wanted  to  try  and  give  it  a  shot  for  the  next  30  days <period> thanks <period> good  morning  everybody <period> i  work  with  really  amazing  little  itty  bitty  creatures  called  cells <period> and  let  me  tell  you  what  it  's  like  to  grow  these  cells  in  the  lab <period> i  work  in  a  lab  where  we  take  cells  out  of  their  native  environment <period> we  plate  them  into  dishes  that  we  sometimes  call  petri  dishes <period> and  we  feed  them <comma> sterilly  of  course <comma> with  what  we  call  cell  culture  media <comma> which  is  like  their  food <comma> and  we  grow  them  in  incubators <period> why  do  i  do  this <questionmark> we  observe  the  cells  in  a  plate <comma> and  they  're  just  on  the  surface <period> but  what  we  're  really  trying  to  do  in  my  lab  is  to  engineer  tissues  out  of  them <period> what  does  that  even  mean <questionmark> well  it  means  growing  an  actual  heart <comma> let  's  say <comma> or  grow  a  piece  of  bone  that  can  be  put  into  the  body <period> not  only  that <comma> but  they  can  also  be  used  for  disease  models <period> and  for  this  purpose <comma> traditional  cell  culture  techniques  just  really  are  n't  enough <period> the  cells  are  kind  of  homesick <period> the  dish  does  n't  feel  like  their  home <period> and  so  we  need  to  do  better  at  copying  their  natural  environment  to  get  them  to  thrive <period> we  call  this  the  biomimetic  paradigm <comma> copying  nature  in  the  lab <period> let  's  take  the  example  of  the  heart <comma> the  topic  of  a  lot  of  my  research <period> what  makes  the  heart  unique <questionmark> well <comma> the  heart  beats <comma> rhythmically <comma> tirelessly <comma> faithfully <period> we  copy  this  in  the  lab  by  outfitting  cell  culture  systems  with  electrodes <period> these  electrodes  act  like  mini  pacemakers  to  get  the  cells  to  contract  in  the  lab <period> what  else  do  we  know  about  the  heart <questionmark> well  heart  cells  are  pretty  greedy <period> nature  feeds  the  heart  cells  in  your  body  with  a  very <comma> very  dense  blood  supply <period> in  the  lab <comma> we  micro-pattern  channels  in  the  biomaterials  on  which  we  grow  the  cells <period> and  this  allows  us  to  flow  the  cell  culture  media <comma> the  cells  food <comma> through  the  scaffolds  where  we  're  growing  the  cells <comma> a  lot  like  what  you  might  expect  from  a  capillary  bed  in  the  heart <period> so  this  brings  me  to  lesson  number  one <comma> life  can  do  a  lot  with  very  little <period> let  's  take  the  example  of  electrical  stimulation <period> let  's  see  how  powerful  just  one  of  these  essentials  can  be <period> on  the  left <comma> we  see  a  tiny  piece  of  beating  heart  tissue  that  i  engineered  from  rat  cells  in  the  lab <period> it  's  about  the  size  of  a  mini  marshmallow <period> and  after  one  week <comma> it  's  beating <period> you  can  see  it  in  the  upper  left-hand  corner <period> but  do  n't  worry  if  you  cannot  see  it  so  well <period> it  's  amazing  that  these  cells  beat  at  all <period> but  what  's  really  amazing  is  that  the  cells <comma> when  we  electrically  stimulate  them  like  with  a  pacemaker <comma> that  they  beat  so  much  more <period> but  that  brings  me  to  lesson  number  two <comma> cells  do  all  the  work <period> in  a  sense <comma> tissue  engineers  have  a  bit  of  an  identity  crisis  here <comma> because  structural  engineers  build  bridges  and  big  things <comma> computer  engineers <comma> computers <comma> but  what  we  are  doing  is  actually  building  enabling  technologies  for  the  cells  themselves <period> what  does  this  mean  for  us <questionmark> let  's  do  something  really  simple <period> let  's  remind  ourselves  that  cells  are  not  an  abstract  concept <period> let  's  remember  that  our  cells  sustain  our  lives  in  a  very  real  way <period> we  are  what  we  eat <comma> could  easily  be  described  as <comma> we  are  what  our  cells  eat <period> and  in  the  case  of  the  flora  in  our  gut <comma> these  cells  may  not  even  be  human <period> but  it  's  also  worth  noting  that  cells  also  mediate  our  experience  of  life <period> behind  every  sound <comma> sight <comma> touch <comma> taste  and  smell  is  a  corresponding  set  of  cells  that  receive  this  information  and  interpret  it  for  us <period> it  begs  the  question <comma> shall  we  expand  our  sense  of  environmental  stewardship  to  include  the  ecosystem  of  our  own  bodies <questionmark> i  invite  you  to  talk  about  this  with  me  further <comma> and  in  the  meantime <comma> i  wish  you  luck <period> may  none  of  your  non-cancer  cells  become  endangered  species <period> thank  you <period>
